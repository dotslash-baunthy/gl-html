    <b>Plot: </b>As a time-travelling agent is trying to disarm a bomb, he is confronted by a person who tries to stop
    him and a gunfight ensues. Despite this, the agent manages to reach the bomb again, but it explodes and burns his
    face. Someone approaches and helps him to grasp his time-travelling device, which transports him to a hospital in
    the future. While the agent is recovering from facial reconstruction and symptoms of psychosis, it is revealed that
    he has been trying to prevent the attack of the so-called "Fizzle Bomber" in New York in 1975. After his recovery,
    he receives his last assignment.</br>
    The agent moves to 1970s New York. As a bartender, he starts a conversation with one of the customers. The customer
    writes true confession articles under the pen name "The Unmarried Mother." This pseudonym is explained by his own
    life story, which he tells the agent.</br>
    Born female, the customer grew up as "Jane" in an orphanage. She excelled in her studies but had difficulty fitting
    in. Jane decided any children she had would be raised in a proper family and thus avoided relationships. As an adult
    she applied for a program called "Space Corp", which promised women the chance to go to space while providing
    astronauts with intimate R&R, but she was later disqualified because of a medical condition which had never before
    been revealed to her but which greatly interested a man named Robertson.</br>
    In 1963, Jane bumped into a man who said he was waiting for someone. The two eventually fell in love, but one day
    the man disappeared. In time, Robertson approached Jane, revealing that Space Corp was really a part of the Temporal
    Agency, which now wanted to recruit her. They broke off contact when it was discovered that Jane was pregnant with
    her ex-lover's baby. While performing a Caesarean section, doctors discovered Jane was intersex, possessing internal
    male and female sex organs. Complications during the birth forced them to remove her female sex organs; she then
    underwent a gender reassignment and began living as a man. Furthermore, her baby was stolen by a mysterious man.
    Ever since then Jane, who now goes by John, has been living a bitter life, writing fiction as "The Unmarried
    Mother."</br>
    The agent offers to take John back in time to the day that Jane met the man who would later become her lover and
    leave her, so that John can take revenge and kill the man for ruining his (Jane's) life. In return, John will take
    over the agent's job for whatever duration he wishes. The agent reveals his time-travel device and the two jump to
    that day in 1963. John intends to kill his past lover prior to the moment when the lover first meets Jane. While
    waiting, John encounters Jane, and as they begin talking, John realizes that he is the man who later becomes Jane's
    lover. The baby born from this "self-fertilization" is stolen by the agent, who uses the time machine to take the
    baby to an orphanage in 1945. Therefore, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a predestination
    paradox.</br>
    The agent goes to 1975 New York, where he helps his burned self from the beginning of the film. The agent returns to
    1963, a few months after he dropped John off. He convinces John to leave Jane behind, and he uses his time machine
    to take them both to the Temporal Agency. John takes over the agent's job so the agent can retire in 1975 New York,
    close to the day of the Fizzle Bomber's attack. Upon entering this time period, the agent discovers that the
    time-travel device does not decommission itself as planned and can still be used. Following orders, he goes to a
    laundromat at the moment the Fizzle Bomber will be there. The Fizzle Bomber turns out to be the agent's own future
    self, now suffering from psychosis as a result of excessive time travel. The Fizzle Bomber insists that his actions
    have saved and will save more lives than have been lost because he bombed places before potential mass murderers
    could use them, and that they ultimately lead to the reinforcement of the Temporal Agency. He tries to convince the
    agent that the only way to end the cycle is for the agent to spare his life. The agent denies he will ever become
    the Fizzle Bomber and kills his future self.</br>
    The film finally reveals that in 1975, John is the man who traveled to New York and was burned while disarming a
    bomb. His subsequent facial reconstruction significantly changes his appearance, and it is now clear that Jane,
    John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person. This agent's creation was ultimately orchestrated by
    Robertson to create an agent who has no ties to time. This temporal agent was responsible for both his own
    conception and death; he has driven the predestination paradox to its limit.</p>
